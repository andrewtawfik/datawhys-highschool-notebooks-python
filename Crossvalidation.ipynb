However, to make sure the data they collected was accurate, Rin suggested they use a new method called cross-validation. Ever since they looked at random forests, they wanted to look at other approaches that would lessen the randomness. While random forest helped with the randomness when looking at categorical data, cross-validation might help with the numerical data, like CO2 emissions and the number of fuel gallons used. Maybe with this method, they can find which factor is causing the most pollution in their city!"

Once we’ve ‘chunked’ our data into folds, each fold takes turns being used for training or testing. Then you build as many models as there are folds, using a different fold for testing each time.

    "**Explanation**: *The classification report provides some metrics, particularly precision and recall. Precision measures how many of the samples the model labeled as contaminated were actually contaminated, essentially showing the accuracy of its positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, reflects the model's ability to detect all actual contaminated samples, indicating how well it \"found\" the true cases. In this report, the precision and recall scores are both high, at 0.99 or 99% for each class, which demonstrates that the model is highly accurate in identifying both contaminated and non-contaminated samples. These scores mean that nearly all positive predictions made by the model were correct, and it missed almost none of the actual contaminated cases.*"

    "Cross-validation helps us use all our data for training and testing with specific tools to avoid overfitting. By splitting data into sections and testing different parts at different times, our model gets better at making predictions.  Grid search helps find the best hyperparameters by testing more than one option. Remember, it’s important to  test hyperparameters on the same data we trained on, so that we don’t get misleading results."
