As they all look at the data, they notice that much of the data is numerical, and they’re not really sure how to go forward from here. The club used decision trees to help make predictions based on category, but now they also want to look at the numerical data like temperature, number of CO2 emissions, and gasoline used. Even the most experienced group members are feeling overwhelmed by all of the information. But then, Angela remembers learning something about regression trees and how this could be used for all of their numerical data. Maybe this could help!"

Those categories are like little boxes where any point inside gets the same prediction - the average. To make things simple, each region looks like a rectangle, like you can see in Figure 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s think back to the example. When we looked at the decision tree notebook, we had categories like whether or not someone will ‘pass’ or ‘fail’. What if instead of ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ categories, we wanted to predict their grade on a scale of 0-100? Also, we can rethink categories for their year in school (‘freshman’, ‘sophomore’, ‘junior’ or ‘senior’), and instead use the number of theirage. Lastly, how about we transform variables like ‘received extra tutoring (yes/no)’ and ‘extracurricular activities (yes/no’) into the number of hours they did for each of these things. In many cases, we can use the average value of the data that reaches that leaf.\n",

    "\n",
    "Big trees can show a lot of data, which isn’t always bad. However, if a regression tree is too big, it can make predictions less accurate. To fix this, we use a process called pruning, where we force the tree to be smaller. There are various ways to prune, like restricting the size of the leaves or the number of branches. Pruning makes the tree smaller and easier to understand. The goal is to keep just enough data, grouped closely together, so the predictions are more accurate and easier to trust."

    "**Explanation**:  *The training dataset contains information about different car models and their CO2 emissions. Each row includes the brand (e.g., Toyota, Ford), model, volume (likely engine size), weight, and CO2Emission level. Heavier cars or those with larger engine volumes tend to have higher CO2 emissions because they use more fuel. For example, smaller cars like the Toyota Prius have lower emissions, while larger vehicles like the Ford F-150 have higher emissions. This data helps a model learn the relationship between features like volume and weight and their impact on CO2 emissions*."

The fit function makes the model learn the relationship between weight and volume, with CO2 emissions from this data. You have also calculated the model's R-squared score on the training data. The R-squared score, which is 0.86 (or 86%), shows how well the model’s predictions match the actual CO2 emissions. A score close to 1 (or 100%) means the model is doing a good job. Here, 0.86 means the model explains 86% of the variation in CO2 emissions based on weight and volume, indicating it's a fairly accurate model*."

    "**Explanation**: *You have calculated a metric called R-squared to evaluate how well a model’s predictions match the actual values. The R-squared score is a number between 0 and 1. If it’s close to 1, it means the model’s predictions are very close to the actual values, so it’s doing a good job. If it’s closer to 0, it means the predictions aren’t very accurate. In short, a higher R-squared means a better model*."
