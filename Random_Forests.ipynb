The model was a little too perfect—so perfect that it wasn’t helpful when presented with new situations. They looked into this a bit more and realized that everytime they ran a decision tree, it was taking a random subset of the data. So how could they use the power of decision trees, but not worry about the random split between the training and testing data?\n",

    "After selecting features to create a random forest model (goal 4), how does this model work? Because we have many ‘random’ trees, we could also make predictions become more reliable by using bootstrapping and randomly selecting those features to make a tree. Instead of using every variable or feature to make each tree, the algorithm will pick a random set of features (variables) to select. This helps the trees become even more unique, with their own specific identities!\n",

    "Ultimately, a random forest is excellent because it can help us combine and consider parts of many different trees. Whether it’s predicting if someone will pass or fail a class….or how many miles an electric scooter can travel with one charge, random forests work like a team—we can help minimize the bias from just one tree.\n"
