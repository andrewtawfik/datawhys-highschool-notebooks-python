    "Kofi, a new member of the group, recognizes that the team has difficulties in predicting what type of transportation people are more likely to choose, such as bikes, scooters, or cars. To help think through the categorical data, the team he suggests using decision trees. Kofi explains that decision trees work by splitting up data at each layer that uses categories like efficiency, cost, and convenience to help with predictions. For example, the first layer of the tree might split based on high or low efficiency. At other layers the tree might consider other variables such as cost categories like expensive or cheap. This structure helps the team to break down complex data into manageable chunks for better informed decisions, especially predictions. As the team learns how decision trees work, Kofi realizes this method will help them see their data in different ways and find patterns they haven’t seen before\n"

Or maybe we want to predict whether something is contaminated or not contaminated. The decision tree algorithm tries to find the predictor that gives us the best classification.\n",

As each predictor is considered, it adds new layers and there are fewer and fewer datapoints under each layer. The last layer that has all our final outcome is called the **leaf node**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dig into an example. Let’s say you want to predict how someone will do in a class using categories like ‘pass’ or ‘fail’. The most impactful predictor might be grade level - 'middle school' and 'high school'. Under that, you might have another set of categories like ‘received extra tutoring (yes/no)’ or another leaf node that says ‘extracurricular activities (yes/no’). At the bottom level, we will find the leaf nodes that show us the best combination of predictors that will help us understand if a student will ‘pass’ or ‘fail’\n",

To fix this, we use a process called **pruning**, where we force the tree to be smaller. Pruning makes the tree smaller and easier to understand. The goal is to keep just enough data, grouped closely together, so the predictions are more accurate and easier to trust."

    "**Explanation**: *The classification report provides some metrics, particularly precision and recall. Precision measures how many of the samples the model labeled as contaminated were actually contaminated, essentially showing the accuracy of its positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, reflects the model's ability to detect all actual contaminated samples, indicating how well it \"found\" the true cases. In this report, the precision and recall scores are both high, at 0.99 or 99% for each class, which demonstrates that the model is highly accurate in identifying both contaminated and non-contaminated samples. These scores mean that nearly all positive predictions made by the model were correct, and it missed almost none of the actual contaminated cases*.\n"
